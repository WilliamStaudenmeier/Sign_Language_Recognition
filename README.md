# Sign_Language_Recognition

Did you know that you can use deep learning to detect hand gestures and sign language as well as facial expressions?

This past weekend, my friends Manas Kukreja and Gautham Sai M R from The University of Texas at Dallas helped me train a deep learning model for basic hand-gesture and sign language recognition.

You can use a simple model like this to program an intelligent robot to perform basic tasks, or build a model that interprets sign language from YouTube videos.

From a #python #programming standpoint, we used the #opencv and #tensorflow packages to build our toy model. In addition to the simple gestures on the video, it also interprets the ASL alphabet. Thanks!
